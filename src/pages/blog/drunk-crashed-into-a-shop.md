<h2>A drunk crashed into a building. A Witness Words:</h2>
<br>
<br>
Ohhh well it's really quite funny I was, I was in bed sleepin' at ahhh 2'o'clock this mornin' me wife comes in and says: "Ohhh the shops been, ahhhh, someone ran into the shop!" And I said "Oooahhhh what!?" 
<br>
<br>
So aahhh I jumped outta bed and all I had was me undies on and I've walked out the front and I seen ahhh the car smashed and I seen the bloke walkin' back to the car! And so I've walked outside and I said "Oahhh whatayadoin' mate!?
<br>
<br>
Like, ya can't be leavin' the scene," and he goes "Don't be a hero mate," and I said "I'm not tryna be a hero, but the police are commin'," and he just decided he'd scoot up the road and I just said "Naahh it's not goin' on like that mate."
<br>
<br>
So I jumped in me car and I started chasing him up the road and then he went down a side street and then the police were commin' and I flashed them and sent them off in the direction of him, but MATE, all I had was me jocks on and I was chasin' him up the street and I'm just like "MATE, LIKE!"
