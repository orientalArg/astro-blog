One of the few virtues I have and I'm most proud of is my memory, since I was a child I had a very visually sharp type of memory and since then up until now it hasn't change a bit. <br/><br/>

So if you, the reader, is ready to "read" a rather personal story, be prepare because this will not be a short drive. In order to get into the point where I am now in which I can decide with whom I'm working with I needed many things to happened. <br/><br/><br/>

<h2 class="title" id="1">A Computer:</h2>
<br/>
Growing up poor in a small house in a dirt-roaded always-flooded by storms neighbourhood on the beautiful Argentinian "región mesopotámica" getting a decades old computer when I was about 9yo was a blessing.
<br/>
<br/>
The reason why I receive such a dogshit of a computer was because of my always empathy driven mother convince my father of buying our family first pc off of her sick uncle to help him pay for his expenses.

The yellow carcass and the thick glass of the small screen are some of the most notorious characteristic of such invention. This was nothing but a slow machine that it couldn't be updated because of how old it was, the computer was so old it utilized floppy disk, and let me remind you this was around the year 2009.<br/><br/>

The only person that seems to have enjoyed such mechanic wonder was my mom which take advantage of it and got amusement playing solitaire for many years. <br/><br/>

But for me wasn't anything but a rather mediocre medium of entertainment, so I kept playing video games in consoles for a while.

<h4 class="dark"> My modern Computer</h4><br/>

After so many tasteless Christmas and many years of purposefully brainwashing my parents with sarcastic insistence from my brothers and I, our always absent dad decided that was time to change the pc. 
<br/><br/>
And this time with a little assessment by the retail store my family finally acquired a "modern computer" that was adequate not only for gaming but also web search thanks to a cheap internet modem.
<br/><br/>
And that's how my web journey begun. Journey which will finally lead myself into some facebook groups then into military forums and finally I got into hacking forums.<br/><br/><br/>

<h2 class="title" id="2">My plans</h2>
<br/>
I was so hooked up into hacking forums that I couldn't help but try any app and script I found in those posts.
<br/>
For the first time since I was a child I didn't feel less than other people because of how many limitations I had while growing up. It felt great I felt like I was the most knowledgeable person ever.<br/><br/>

<h4 class="dark">From script kiddie to pentester</h4>
<br/>
It was the year 2014 I was 14yo when my mom decided that going to a technical scholl 10hs a day it wasn't enough and I started taking English lessons after school and so I did for a full year of missery.
