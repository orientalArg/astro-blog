<h2 class="red">Tourism After the pandemic</h2>
<br>
Over the past year, Buenos Aires has seen a resuscitation of a good part of the tourism sector, which was plagued by the closures of the pandemic isolation: 80 percent of available hotel rooms were recovered and reopened before 2020. Today, according to Entur records, the city has almost 53,000 beds available. The companies that were best positioned to weather the storm of the pandemic were the capitalâ€™s top five-star hotels, with a 100 percent recovery rate in available beds. Four-star establishments recovered 94 percent of beds, with three-star hotels at 89 percent availability.
<br><br>
Economically, the hotel business generated around US$1.8 billion for the city's economy, with an important impact on related sectors, mainly in gastronomy, transport and culture. The "average" expenditure of national tourists during their stay in the city was US$124 for nationals and US$776 for international travellers.
